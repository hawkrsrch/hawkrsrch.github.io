I am excited to join [Ole Miss](https://olemiss.edu/) this Fall as an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science](https://cs.olemiss.edu/). My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, particularly in human modeling (e.g., human pose and human-objection interaction), and applications such as robotics and healthcare. I obtained my PhD from the School of Computing at the University of Utah. After completing my PhD, I have been working in industry research labs as a Research Scientist at GE Global Research, Senior Researcher at Tencent US, and Principal Researcher at CtrsVision from 2015 and 2024. 

Prospective students: If you are interested in pursuing a PhD at Ole Miss and would like to work with me, please email your CV and transcript with the subject line “[25Spring (or other semester you plan to start) PhD Application - Your Name].” Current Ole Miss students are encouraged to schedule a meeting to discuss opportunities in person.
