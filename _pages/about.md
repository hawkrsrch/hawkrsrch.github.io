I am excited to join [Ole Miss](https://olemiss.edu/) this Fall as an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science](https://cs.olemiss.edu/). My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, particularly in human modeling (e.g., human pose and human-objection interaction), and applications such as robotics and healthcare. I obtained my PhD from the School of Computing at the University of Utah. After completing my PhD, I have been working in industry research labs as a Research Scientist at GE Global Research, Senior Researcher at Tencent US, and Principal Researcher at CtrsVision from 2015 and 2024. 

‚≠ê I am actively looking for motivated PhD students to become part of my research team. If you're passionate about research in computer vision and machine learning, I'd love to hear from you. Please email me your CV and transcript with the subject line "[25Spring (or other semester you plan to start) PhD Application - Your Name]".
