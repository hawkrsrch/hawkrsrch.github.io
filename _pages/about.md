Welcome to my research site. I am currently a Principal Researcher at CtrsVision. Previously, I was a Senior Researcher at Tencent US and a Research Scientist at GE Global Research. I obtained my Ph.D. from the School of Computing at the University of Utah in 2015. My computer vision work spans a broad spectrum of topics and domains including human pose and motion analysis, face reconstruction, 3D vision, robotics, biomedical and health sciences.

I'm excited to announce that I'm recruiting two PhD students to join my lab in [computer science](https://cs.olemiss.edu/) at [Ole Miss](https://olemiss.edu/), starting this fall (or next spring). If you're passionate about research in computer vision and AI, I'd love to hear from you. Please email me your CV and transcript with the subject line "[24Fall/25Spring PhD Application - Your Name]". Let's explore how we can work together to push the boundaries of what's possible in our field.
