I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science](https://cs.olemiss.edu/) at [Ole Miss](https://olemiss.edu/). My research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, particularly in human-centric tasks such as human pose and human-objection interaction. For more information about my research, explore [my blog post](/blog/2024/research-impact) highlighting the impact of computer vision and deep learning research.

I obtained my PhD from the School of Computing at the University of Utah. After completing my PhD, I spent nearly a decade in industry research labs, with positions from Research Scientist to Principal Researcher at GE Global Research, Tencent US, and CtrsVision.

Prospective students: If you are interested in pursuing a PhD at Ole Miss and would like to work with me, please email your CV and transcript with the subject line “[25Spring (or other semester you plan to start) PhD Application - Your Name].” Current Ole Miss students are encouraged to schedule a meeting to discuss opportunities in person.
