I am a researcher at CtrsVision, this is my research webpage. Previously, I held positions as a Senior Researcher at Tencent US and as a Research Scientist at GE Global Research. I obtained my Ph.D. from the School of Computing at the University of Utah in 2015. I design and build computer vision solutions in areas including human pose and motion analysis, face reconstruction, 3D vision, robotics, biomedical and health sciences. My work has been published in leading computer vision venues (CVPR,ICCV,AAAI,TPAMI,etc). I serve as an AC/TPC member for top-tier international conferences (CVPR,ECCV,ICCV,AAAI,etc) and as a reviewer for leading journals (IJCV,TIP,etc) in the fields of computer vision and AI.
