Welcome to my research site, where I share my research in computer vision and machine learning. The work I do spans a broad spectrum of topics and domains, including human modeling (pose and action), 3D vision, robotics, and applications in biomedical and health sciences. Currently, I am a Principal Researcher at CtrsVision. My previous roles include Senior Researcher at Tencent US and Research Scientist at GE Global Research. I obtained my Ph.D. from the School of Computing at the University of Utah in 2015.

I'm excited to announce that I will be joining [Ole Miss](https://olemiss.edu/) this Fall as an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science](https://cs.olemiss.edu/). I am currently recruiting two PhD students to join my lab, starting this fall (or next spring). If you're passionate about research in computer vision and machine learning, I'd love to hear from you. Please email me your CV and transcript with the subject line "[24Fall/25Spring PhD Application - Your Name]". Let's explore how we can work together to push the boundaries of what's possible in our field.
