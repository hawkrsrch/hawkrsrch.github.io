Welcome to my research webpage. I am currently a Principal Researcher at CtrsVision. Before this role, I was a Senior Researcher at Tencent US and a Research Scientist at GE Global Research. I earned my Ph.D. from the School of Computing at the University of Utah in 2015. My computer vision work spans a broad spectrum of topics and domains including human pose and motion analysis, face reconstruction, 3D vision, robotics, biomedical and health sciences.
