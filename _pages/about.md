I am an Assistant Professor in [Computer Science](https://cs.olemiss.edu/) at [Ole Miss](https://olemiss.edu/). My research interests in computer vision and deep learning focus on enhancing the robustness and generalization of models, with applications to human-centric tasks such as human pose estimation and human-object interaction. I obtained my PhD from the School of Computing at the University of Utah. After that, I spent nearly a decade in industry research labs at GE Global Research, Tencent US, and CtrsVision. In both industry and academia, I regularly serve as a Program Committee/Area Chair for leading AI and computer vision venues, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and AAAI, among others.
